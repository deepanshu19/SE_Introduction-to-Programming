//4.Write code using nested loops to print a pattern of alternating 0s and 1s in a grid, like the checkered background seen in some Spotify playlist covers (e.g., for a 4x4 grid, alternate 0 and 1 in each cell).

#include<stdio.h>

int main(){
int i,j;

for(i=1;i<=4;i++){
    for(j=1;j<=4;j++){
        printf("%d",(i+j)%2);
    }
    printf("\n");
}

return 0;
}
